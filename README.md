## Description

Currently, FastFriends is building a per-bike monitoring for maintenance.  The app tracks when a user has updated various parts and how much they have ridden since, recommending when a user should change things.

For instance, a user can indicate they replaced their chain, and the application will recommend a new one after 1500 miles.

There are two servers in FastFriends: backend and frontend.  Refer to each subdirectory's readme to install and run those servers.
